This is a VISIBLE copy of the hidden .npmrc file

The actual .npmrc file exists in your project root but is hidden because it starts with a dot (.)

=====================================
CONTENTS OF .npmrc:
=====================================

loglevel=error
progress=false
fund=false
audit=false

=====================================
WHAT THIS DOES:
=====================================

This file makes npm installs faster and cleaner by:
- Reducing log output (loglevel=error)
- Hiding progress bars (progress=false)
- Skipping funding messages (fund=false)
- Skipping security audit (audit=false)

=====================================
DO YOU NEED TO SEE IT?
=====================================

NO! The file exists and will work automatically on Render.
You don't need to see it or edit it.

This NPMRC_COPY.txt file is just for your reference.

=====================================
